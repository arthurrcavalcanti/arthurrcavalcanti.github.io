                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Arthur Cavalcanti. I was born in 1990, I say that because I'm actually having to calculate in order to rememebter how old I am. Somehow I got merried, got two dogs and a nice job.</p>
                <p>My wife is Gabriela Alves. I think she likes me. We are pretty happy with our simple life. You see, we are not <i>people</i> people, we like to be with ourselves, and our dogs, and that is it.</p>
                <p>We like to watch movies and tv shows. She likes to take care of plants, I like to be in my computer. If we could, we would travel more, but money is always tight.</p>

                <p>This is Walter, I think he must have been the best cat in the world. He got to us when he was only 3 months old.</p>
